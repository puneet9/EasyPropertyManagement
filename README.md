# EasyPropertyManagement

A Simple web application for managing rental property assets.

1. Clone the Repository and perform npm install followed by npm start for both fronbtend and backend.
2. Open your browser at localhost:4200.
3. I have added non-function UI for login and registeration page. So just click login button and that will take you to the list of properties page.
4. You can click on any property and that will display you units available in that property and their floor and rent.
